## Data organization
Create folder `data` and place elements as shown below:
```angular2
data/
  dataset/
    {person1}/
      img1
      img2
      ...
    {person2}/
      img1
      img2
      ...
    ...
    test_video.mp4
```
Replace `{person}` with names who you want to recognize and track; `test_video` will be detected automatically.
